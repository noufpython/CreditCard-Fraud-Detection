## 🛠️ Machine Learning Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression 
- Random Forest 
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
- Naive Bayes 
- Decision Tree 
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN using TensorFlow) 
- Linear Regression (baseline) 

## 📊 Preprocessing

- **Standardization** of `Amount` and `Time` features using `StandardScaler`
- **SMOTE** applied to handle class imbalance on training data
- **train_test_split** with `stratify=y` to preserve label distribution

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC Score

Visual results are stored under `Visualizations/`.
